Globals can be accessed anywhere in your script (globally). \
Microcontrollers have some [[Roblox Globals]] modified from vanilla Roblox, and [[Microcontroller Globals]] which you can use to interact with the game.

## [[Roblox Globals]]
Globals that are present in Roblox. Pilot.lua makes some modifications to these globals in order for their usage to be safe.
## [[Microcontroller Globals]]
Globals that are specific to pilot.lua. These globals are how you can interact with the game from a microcontroller in Waste of Space.
